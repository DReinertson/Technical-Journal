# Technical-Journal
Journal of thought process, progress and ideas

Within each repository, starting now, I will be writing out my thought process and ideas, progress and what I have learned that day or through the project. This repository will be a collection of those entries, as well as journal entries of learned material that may not be part of a project (i.e. reading on how to use GIT properly through cmd line, choosing which IDE to use, etc). I will often include websites or sources that I used in order to achieve this information and will try to put examples into the entry as well. 
I'm doing this in the hopes of accurately documenting my progess and being able to use this as a way to track my own progress. I will try to include roadblocks I come across and how I overcome them in an organized fasion.
