    Alright, starting to learn how to effectively use GIT. Did the Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) course on learning Git and I feel like it didn't quite cover it to the extent I was hoping for. 
    I find myself not knowing how to even begin the process of using git commands. Not sure how to add a file into a repository or what the point of starting repositories on my personal computer is. 
    But my first accomplisment using git will be getting the technical journal from my web scraper into this repository.
